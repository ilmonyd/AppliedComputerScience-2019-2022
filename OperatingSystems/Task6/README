* Content:
============

This directory contains a program that tests out semaphores in POSIX

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here I implemented mutual exclusion for processes, with POSIX standard
named semaphores. For a demonstration purposes the program shows
different info about processes before, during and after critical section.
The program contains these files:
   1)process.c
   2)mysem.c, mysem.h
   3)creator.c
   4)number.txt

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Running the program:
=========================

The directory contains a makefile for the ease of compilation, as well
as cleaning and compressing the directory to an archive.

-> To run the program use:
       make run

-> To clean the directory (remove unwanted files):
       make clean

-> To compress the directory into a .tar.gz archive:
       make tar
