* Content:
============

This directory contains a program using fork() with execl(), and
a simple program that prints out the IDs of its process.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

First one is a program that forks itself in a loop, then starts another
executable via execl() function, which prints out its process' IDs.The 
main executable i.e. main.x requires two arguments - path to an 
executable and it's name. For example:
$ ./main.x /bin/ls ls
You can test the program using your own executables after running make.

Second one is just a very simple program that prints out UID, GID, PID,
PPID and PGID of itself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program that is passed to the execl() function here will run 3 times
because as the execl() replaces the calling process image with a new 
process image. (having no more fork() function in it)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Running the program:
=========================

The directory contains a makefile for the ease of compilation, as well
as cleaning and compressing the directory to an archive.

-> To run the program with predefined executables use:
       make run

-> To run a test of the fork() + execl() using ls program as executable:
       make test

-> To clean the directory (remove unwanted files):
       make clean

-> To compress the directory into a .tar.gz archive:
       make tar
