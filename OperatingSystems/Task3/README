* Content:
============

This directory contains three programs that test out the signal handling

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first program sets a user-selected signal handling mode:

->  default
->  ignore
->  custom

The second one fork-execs the first one and sets a user-selected signal
handling mode in it, then it sends a kill signal of a selected choice 
to the already mentioned child process.

The third program creates a child process which becomes a leader of its
own group and also spawns its own child processes. Then the main process
sends a signal to the whole new-born group of processes.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Running the program:
=========================

The directory contains a makefile for the ease of compilation, as well
as cleaning and compressing the directory to an archive.

To run the programs you need to select one of the signal handling modes
and a signal that is supposed to be handled.
e.g.:
       $ ./a.x ignore 20
Check "kill -l" for the list of available signals.

-> To run a test of the first program using "custom 2" setting:
       make test_a

-> To run a test of the second program using "custom 2" setting:
       make test_b

-> To run a test of the third program using "default 2" setting:
       make test_c

-> To clean the directory (remove unwanted files):
       make clean

-> To compress the directory into a .tar.gz archive:
       make tar
