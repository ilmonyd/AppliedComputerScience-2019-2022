* Content:
============

This directory contains three programs that test out the FIFO.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two programs are producer and consumer programs, which read data from
file then push it to FIFO and read data from FIFO then write it to file
respectively.

The third one is a simple main program which runs prior ones in separate
processes.

Task a involves running the whole process using main program.
Task b runs producer and consumer programs in separate xterm sessions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Running the program:
=========================

The directory contains a makefile for the ease of compilation, as well
as cleaning and compressing the directory to an archive.

-> To run task a:
       make run_a

-> To run task b:
       make run_b

-> To clean the directory (remove unwanted files):
       make clean

-> To compress the directory into a .tar.gz archive:
       make tar
